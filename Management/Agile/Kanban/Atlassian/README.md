## [Kanban Overview](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban)

Kanban is an implementation of agile principles.  
It requires real-time communication and work transparency.  
It is a just-in time methodology.  
Kanban matches the amount of work in progress (WIP) to team's capacity.  

You will need:  
* a board  
* cards  

A Kanban board visualizes the flow of work.  

A basic three-step workflow:  
* To-Do  
* In-Progress/Doing  
* Done  

You may want to add other steps such as code review.  

Kanban cards should only include critical information.  

The benefits of Kanban are:
* planning flexibility: cards are plucked from the top of the backlog
* short time cycle: cycle time should be as short as possible; overlapping skills reduce cycle time; share skills with others
* fewer bottlenecks: don't multitask, do your work in progress
* visual metrics: you can use control charts and cumulative flow diagrams to remove bottlenecks
* continuous delivery: integrate and deliver all the time

### [Kanban boards](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards)

Components:
* Visual Signals: each card could encapsulate one user story or work item
* Columns: cards flow through the workflow until completion: `To Do`, `In Progress`, `Complete` or much more complex
* Work In Progress (WIP) Limits: maximum number of cards that can be in one column at any given time. Exposes bottlenecks and work over commitment.  
* Commitment point: where the workflow begins
* Delivery point: where the workflow ends

Lead Time is the time it takes a card to go from the Commitment to the Delivery point.  

#### Kanban vs. Scrum board

| Differences     | Scrum                          | Kanban                       |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Work            | Sprints start and end          | Continous                    |
| Roles           | Clearly defined                | Self-organized               |
| Lifecycle       | Cleared and recycled           | Throughout the lifecycle     |
| Task management | Set, strict and with deadlines | Flexible, can be reorganized |

#### Getting started with kanban boards

You'll need to:
* understand the processes
* pursue continuous improvement through evolution
* encourage leadership at every level

Figure out:
* what columns do you need?
* how do you submit a new card?
* how will you make all cards relatively uniform in effort?
* what is the delivery and commitment point?
