How to setup the Python interpreter
===================================

Introduction
------------
Python is an interpreter language with a simple and graceful syntax. Interpreter languages come with an interpreter that execute a program as it is being read. As a consequence, there is no distinction between source files and executable files.

Python distribution
-------------------
Python files are distinguished by the .py extension. In order to executed a Python file, you need to install a Python distribution. A Python distribution is a Python interpreter bundled up with Python libraries. Different distributions have different library bundles. A library is a group of programs that solve a problem. The smallest Python distribution can be found on the official Python website. A recommended Python distribution is Python Anaconda as it comes with many powerful libraries.

Python interpreter
------------------
Python interpreter can be called by typing "python" into the command line. The command will bring up a sandpit where commands can be tested, explored and played with. To exit the sandpit, press CTRL + Z.

Execute a program
-----------------
To make the interpreter execute a Python program, position the command line in the folder where the .py file is located, then type "python <file_name.py>" to run the program.
